# droplet-evaporation-model
In our paper (https://doi.org/10.3390/e25081232), the well-known d2 law analytical model is determined and compared to experimental data that highlight shortcomings of the law. The potential improvements in the d2 law are then discussed, and a numerical model is presented that includes entropy. The resulting code for that numerical model is provided here.
